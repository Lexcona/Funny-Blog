  Added a Blog System
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>September  7, 2025.  5:33 PM</strong></p>
<p>So I got bored and wanted to add a blogging system to my website.<br />
The thing is the last time I did this, it didnt go well and I was using flask with python.<br />
Which in the end was not bad it just didnt look good.<br />
So this time since I am not paying or setting up a backend.<br />
(Mainly since kamatera random will deside to break the wifi config)<br />
<br />
So this time I am using a project called Zola do this.<br />
Which lets me do what I tried to do last time but it actaully looks good.<br />
But because before I was just using github pages for it, I desided to port the whole thing to Zola.<br />
Mainly since it lets me do everything I did before, and lets me sort it the way I had it in flask.<br />
So yeah we will see how this goes.<br />
<br />
Sincerly, Lexcona.</p>
