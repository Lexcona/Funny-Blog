So I got bored and wanted to add a blogging system to my website.\
The thing is the last time I did this, it didnt go well and I was using flask with python.\
Which in the end was not bad it just didnt look good.\
So this time since I am not paying or setting up a backend.\
(Mainly since kamatera random will deside to break the wifi config)\
\
So this time I am using a project called Zora do this.\
Which lets me do what I tried to do last time but it actaully looks good.\
But because before I was just using github pages for it, I desided to port the whole thing to Zora.\
Mainly since it lets me do everything I did before, and lets me sort it the way I had it in flask.\
So yeah we will see how this goes.\

Sincerly, Lexcona.
